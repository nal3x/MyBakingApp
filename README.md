### Make A Baking App

Udacity Coursework

The app uses a google custom search engine to get recipe images that are not present in the json data.
In order to use the app add a file named apikey.properties at the root project directory. This file
must include a line similar to this:
googleapikey="xxx"
where xxx is a valid Google API key
